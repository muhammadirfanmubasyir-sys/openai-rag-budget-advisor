     * A vector embedding is a way of representing data (like words, sentences, or images)
     * as a list of numbers (a vector).
     *
     * These numbers place the data into a multi-dimensional space where items with
     * similar meanings are positioned close together.
     *
     * WordVector [X, Y]        Meaning
     * "Puppy"    [-0.2, -0.9]   Slightly sad, highly animal-related
     * "Kitten"   [-0.1, -0.8]   Slightly sad, highly animal-related
     * "Baby"     [0.8, 0.6]     Highly happy, highly human-related
     *
     * By plotting these vectors, the computer understands that
     * "puppy" is much closer in meaning to "kitten" than to "baby"
     * based entirely on their numerical distance.
